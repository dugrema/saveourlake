          <h3>Who we are</h3>
          We are a small group of concerned
          residents of Russell township. We have
          been fighting the placement of dumps in
          our area. There is still a large parcel of
          land in our area, very close to the village
          of Russell that is still owned by these
          developers. We are concerned that the
          end use of this land could be just as
          harmful to our area as the dump that
          was fought and so we hope to avoid this
          outcome. We hope that you will join with
          us to Save Our Lake.

          <h3>Why is the lake important?</h3>
          Quarry Lake is important to the biodiversity and to the people of this
          area. It contains groundwater in a regional aquifer which supplies local
          wells and likely connects to the Vars-Winchester esker (water source for
          thousands of people). Headwaters of many streams rise on this hill and
          drainage ditches pass immediately beside it. These surface waters flow into
          the Castor River, with one stream into the Bearbrook. The red shale quarry in
          North Russell served its community for generations, and still holds the
          Queenston shale formation, a designated provincially significant resource due to its
          rarity and superior brick-making qualities. The mostly mined property was
          the site of some of Russell Township’s earliest settlements, its first school and
          of course, the brick shale quarry that was the economic making of the village
          of Russell. Directly across from the main entrance is one of the area’s oldest
          cemeteries, which is still in use.
