        "I strongly support the efforts of Save Our Lake. The natural world is in crisis, and the 
        number-one driver of this crisis is the loss of habitat for wild animals and plants. Even 
        if you don't believe that nature has intrinsic value, your rational self-interest should advise 
        you that human life depends on functioning ecosystems. It's imperative that, wherever we 
        have a choice between destroying further habitat and preserving it, we look for ways to 
        preserve it
      </p>
      <p>
        "Quarry Lake may seem insignificant in the global scheme, but every community has a responsibility 
        to nurture its small piece of the natural world. The more communities that accept this responsibility, 
        the more resilient the natural world will be in the face of human-caused climate change. Commercially 
        developing Quarry Lake, when alternative sites are available, not only needlessly destroys habitat 
        for species struggling to survive. It also deprives the community-- children, in particular-- of a 
        place to experience nature in its wildness; it impoverishes the future."

        "Thank you for your noble cause. I certainly do believe that the Quarry Lake Area must be saved,
        as a natural wildlife refuge as it now exists, and not be destroyed through landfill."

      <h2>The Guardians of the Lake need you, and what better time to plan for the future?</h2>
      <p>April 8, 2020</p>

      <p>
        The Guardians of the Lake have an important task for people living within 1.5 kilometres of Quarry Lake in North Russell. It was our
        group’s plan to distribute booklets and information to mailboxes, but the pandemic has made that impractical. So we are distributing
        information electronically. However, we do not have every single person’s email address, so if you are talking to a neighbour or friend
        (at a distance!) who lives near the lake, please ask them if they have received this message, if not, please forward this, and ask them
        to email us at <a href="mailto:savelake@xplornet.com">savelake@xplornet.com</a> if they can participate.
      </p>

      <p>
        To help us assess the biological diversity of Quarry Lake and the area it affects, we are asking for help spotting wildlife, including plants
        and animals. If you live within 1.5 km of Quarry Lake please record what you notice on your property. Send us the results about once a
        month, and we will get them into the EOBase database - <a href="http://www.fragileinheritance.org/projects/database/dbintro.htm">http://www.fragileinheritance.org/projects/database/dbintro.htm</a>. 
        Email them or post them on our Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/715026865650323/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/715026865650323/</a>
        Link to it from our website https://saveourlake.millegrilles.com/.
      </p>

      <p>
        What do we need? Basically, what, where, when, and who.
      </p>

      <p>
        What: The name of the species (common name or Latin name or both). And how was it identified? (For animals, did you see it, its nest,
        tracks, scat, feathers, fur, or did you hear it?)
      </p>

      <p>
        Where: Latitude, longitude, elevation, and habitat. You can find Lat & Long by using a highly detailed map, GPS or Google Maps. Use
        the decimal degrees format - ‘44.87156° N 75.70095° W’ or ‘44.87156, -75.70095’. Type the address in the search bar, zoom in on the
        map until you see the area you observed, tap, right click or hover (depending on device), What’s Here pops up, then tap or click that
        and select the decimal Lat & Long coordinates that pop up. If you are always observing in the same areas, give those places a short
        code name. The database can convert them if we have the code. We have topographical maps, so if you don’t know the elevation, just
        provide the exact location and we can fill in the elevation. Habitat is a basic description, for example, “big-tree Silver Maple farmhouse
        site next to deciduous treed swamp.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When: Date, time, temperature and weather. If you don’t know the exact time or temperature, make an estimate. See the appendix for
        weather abbreviations used by the database.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who: The observers (you & those who were with you) and the person who identified the species. If you don’t know the species
        describe it as carefully as you can. Contact Fred Schueler at bckcdb@istar.ca or Aleta Karstad at karstad@pinicola.ca if you have
        questions about identification or observations. Notes: This is the place for other observations, such as surroundings, sounds of other
        animals, monthly notes of things that are commonly seen (for example, “several Chickadees daily in March” then you don’t need to
        write Chickadees in every entry), and anything else you find interesting. You might note that there are many dead Ash trees, or a lot of
        Woodpecker holes in a trunk, that the drainage ditches are filled with water, or that you can hear a tractor in the next field.
      </p>

      <p>
        What about photos or recordings? Yes! But within limits. Never, ever harass wildlife to see them or take a picture. Some species will not
        reproduce or won’t feed themselves enough if they are disturbed. Never, ever approach any animals’ nests or dens—mothers can be
        fiercely protective. Otherwise, if you are fortunate enough to get a photo or recording, we would be very happy to see it. Send it to
        savelake@xplornet.com. Photos can also include trees, tracks, flowers and yes, roadkill.
      </p>

      <p>
        But do not report rare bird sightings on Facebook or to other lists. This is to prevent too many sightseers pressuring the area. Only
        report uncommon birds directly by email to us. If it is an important species we will alert the right people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Species of special interest: In March and April we are particularly interested in migratory birds and spring ephemeral plants and flowers
        (such as Trilliums, Coltsfoot and Trout Lilies - <a href="https://www.ontariowildflowers.com/">https://www.ontariowildflowers.com/</a>), and in trees and shrubs. Soon we should be
        hearing frog songs. You can learn to identify frog and toad songs by visiting the Herpetological Atlas
        <a href="https://ontarionature.org/programs/citizen-science/reptile-amphibian-atlas/species/#frogs">https://ontarionature.org/programs/citizen-science/reptile-amphibian-atlas/species/#frogs</a> 
        where calls can be heard. We are very interested in ALL amphibians, frogs, toads and salamanders, whether seen or heard. 
        Later as the weather warms, reptiles will come out and we want to know about any snakes or turtles you see. We are interested in 
        all birds, all mammals (particularly Bats <a href="https://onnaturemagazine.com/bat-guide html">https://onnaturemagazine.com/bat-guide html</a> ) all Butterflies Moths and other insects and arachnids (Spiders) The best link for these
        are - <a href="https://bugguide.net">https://bugguide.net</a> - where you can post photos for identification by others. There are some excellent sites for particular groups
        of arthropods, but you need to know what it is you're looking at to use them. Later in the summer you can observe mosses, fungi and
        lichens - <a href="https://mushroomobserver.org/">https://mushroomobserver.org/</a> - as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Caution: If you’re in fields, ditches or woods wear long sleeves, long pants, boots and maybe gloves to protect you from Wild
        (=”Poison”) Parsnip, Stinging Nettle, Poison Ivy (the names give you a clue), thorns, burrs and insect bites. NEVER go on anyone’s land
        without specific permission of the owners, and make sure you leave all gates and fences AS THEY WERE.
        </p>

      <p>
        During the COVID crisis, do not go out observing with friends; go out only with the people you are living with. Children should never go
        out observing alone, and should always have a buddy and/or an adult supervising. We are going through a strange and difficult time,
        but here is a positive contribution we can all make to our future. This time will pass, and that future will come, do not fear!
      </p>

      <h2>Great job!</h2>

      <p>January 26, 2020</p>

      <p>
        The Guardians of the Lake enjoyed a very successful appearance at the Living Locally Fair in Russell on Saturday, Jan. 18. Our table
        was constantly busy and most visitors were amazed by the size and beauty of Quarry Lake, which has been hidden behind the berm on
        Eadie Rd., but which is a 40+ acre lake and a glorious haven for wildlife. Many people stopped by with stories or memories of that
        property and are eager to see it in public hands. Several pages of sign-up sheets (for email updates) were filled, and Russell Township
        Councillors Cindy Saucier and Andre Brisson, plus MP Francis Drouin (and family) expressed support for this campaign. Thanks again to
        the Russell and District Horticultural Society for inviting us and providing the venue. It’s wonderful to have the community so engaged
        and so strong. Save Our Lake!
